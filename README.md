#YupeiLibrary#
&emsp;&emsp; A library includes an STL-like basic library and a DirectUI GUI Framework on Windows with Direct2D.


+ ##Basic Library##
&emsp;&emsp; This part is a basic library which is a custom STL and combined with the C++ Technical Specification implement on Windows and provides

  + Type traits,which is the foundation of the whole basic library;
  + Standard Containers (such as vector,list,etc.);
  + Useful Algorithm with the abstract of iterators;
  + Functional things like function;
  + Smart pointers,which are very useful in GUI development,such as shared_ptr,unique_ptr,intrusive_ptr;
  + Allocators aimed for high performance;
  + Many useful extentions (like the C++ TS),such as filesystem,type-erased allocator,ranges and so on.
